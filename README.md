# Overview

As a software engineer, I am continually seeking to expand my understanding and mastery of different programming languages and paradigms. This project aims to deepen my knowledge of C++ by developing a command-line calculator that performs basic arithmetic operations, exponentiation, and square root calculations. Through this exercise, I have explored key concepts such as dynamic memory allocation, error handling, and the utilization of the C++ Standard Library.

The software I wrote is a simple yet functional command-line calculator. It allows users to perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, exponentiation, and square root calculations. The program is designed to handle invalid inputs gracefully, providing informative error messages when necessary. The calculator demonstrates fundamental C++ programming constructs and the use of object-oriented principles to manage and execute various operations.

The purpose of writing this software is to solidify my understanding of C++ syntax and standard library features while also practicing good software development practices such as modularity, readability, and error handling. By building this calculator, I aimed to create a practical application that showcases my ability to implement core programming concepts in C++.

# Development Environment

The development environment for this project includes the following tools and technologies:

Integrated Development Environment (IDE): Eclipse
Compiler: MinGW
Version Control: Git and GitHub for version control and source code management

The software is written in C++ and utilizes standard libraries such as <iostream>, <sstream>, and <cmath>. These libraries provide essential functionality for input/output operations, string manipulation, and mathematical calculations, respectively.

# Useful Websites

Throughout this project, several websites provided valuable information and guidance:

W3Schools C++ Tutorial - Excellent resource for C++ tutorials and basic programming concepts.
YouTube - Video tutorials and demonstrations that provided practical examples and visual explanations of C++ concepts.

# Future Work

While the current implementation of the calculator is functional, there are several areas for improvement and additional features that could be added in the future:

Implement More Mathematical Functions: Extend the calculator to support trigonometric functions, logarithms, and other advanced mathematical operations.
Enhance User Interface: Develop a graphical user interface (GUI) version of the calculator for better usability and user experience.
Input Validation Enhancements: Improve input validation to handle a wider range of edge cases and provide more robust error handling.
Unit Testing: Implement a suite of unit tests to ensure the correctness and reliability of the calculator's operations.

By addressing these areas, the calculator can be made more comprehensive and user-friendly, further demonstrating the capabilities of C++ in real-world applications.
